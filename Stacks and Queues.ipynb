    "- Using linked lists avoids the issue of stack overflow when we implemented our stack using an array. In that case, adding an item to the stack was fineâ€”until we ran out of space. Then we would have to create an entirely new (larger) array and copy over all of the references from the old array.\n",
    "- That happened because, with an array, we had to specify some initial size (in other words, we had to set aside a contiguous block of memory in advance). But with a linked list, the nodes do not need to be contiguous. They can be scattered in different locations of memory, an that works just fine. This means that with a linked list, we can simply append as many nodes as we like. Using that as the underlying data structure for our stack means that we never run out of capacity, so pushing and popping items will always have a time complexity of O(1)."
